h1. Monterey version 4 example projects

This repository contains several simple actors for Monterey v4 and launchers to run them in Brooklyn.  The actors are:

* *Hello, world*: Receives messages and replies to the sender with a 'hello'
* *Echo*: Replies to messages with whatever data it was sent
* *Pi calculator*: A master actor creates several child actors to calculate chunks of pi and accumulates their responses
* *Ping/pong*: Two actors message each other back and forth
* *Suspend/resume*: Demonstrates that suspending and resuming actors maintains actor state.

Each actor has a corresponding test case demonstrating its behaviour that uses the Monterey Venue test harness.

h2. Building the actors

Clone the repository and build the examples:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cloudsoft/monterey-v4-examples.git
cd monterey-v4-examples
mvn package</code>
</pre>

This will run the actor tests and create a JAR file in <code>simple-actors/target/</code> that can be deployed to a Venue.

h2. Running an actor

TBD
