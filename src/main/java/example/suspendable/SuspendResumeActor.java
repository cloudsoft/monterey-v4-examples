/** 
 * A very simple example of implementing a suspendable Actor.
 *
 * This shows how an actor can preserve its state when being suspended and resumed 
 * (including when being moved to a different location in between). Any subscriptions
 * done in start() will be automatically re-subscribed.
 * 
 * On resume, it will be a different instance of the actor so its fields must be 
 * set on resume.
 * 
 * In this class, the state is a simple counter of the number of messages received.
